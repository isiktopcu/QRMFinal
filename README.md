**QRMProject: "Economic Sanctions: A Threat to the Political Stability of Target States? "**


This study investigates the impact of economic sanctions on the political stability of target countries, a subject of enduring debate and policy relevance.
Utilizing cross sectional data, we examine how the severity of sanctions correlates with political stability. Our findings reveal a negative relationship
between the severity of sanctions and political stability, creating evidence
that economic sanctions have in fact a negative impact on the political stability of target countries. This study argues for a more cautious and nuanced
application of economic sanctions, given their potential to destabilize target
countries politically.

**Models:** OLS, OLS with transformations, Gamma and Polynomial Regressions.


**Data:** The economic sanctions data used in this research is from World Governance Indicators 2022 Political Stability and Absence No Violence dataset.
The economic sanctions data was acquired from Threat and Imposition of
Sanctions (TIES) Data 4.0. A proxy variable called “Severity” for the economic sanctions severity measure was calculated through the mean of 3 vari-
ables (anticipatedtargetcostsz ”, ”targetcostsz ”, and”sendereconomiccostsf igurez ”)
from the sanctions dataset. For controls, we used GDP per capita, inflation
rate and unemployment rate. This data was acquired from through World
Bank API.
