**QRMFinal: Economic Sanctions: A Threat the Political Stability of Target States?**


This study investigates the impact of economic sanctions on the political sta
bility of target countries, a subject of enduring debate and policy relevance.
Utilizing cross sectional data, we examine how the severity of sanctions cor
relates with political stability. Our findings reveal a negative relationship
between the severity of sanctions and political stability, creating evidence
that economic sanctions have in fact a negative impact on the political sta
bility of target countries. This study argues for a more cautious and nuanced
application of economic sanctions, given their potential to destabilize target
countries politically.
